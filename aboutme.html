          Greetings from Colorado!  I just moved to the north Denver Metro area after a lifetime in Texas.  I graduated from Tyler Junior College in 2012 with an Associates Degree in Medical Office Management, and then earned my Bachelors Degree in Health Studies from Texas Woman's University in 2020.  I spent eight years working remotely for a worker's compensation insurance company before I started as a business analyst for a worker's compensation insurance company in 2021, working side-by-side with developers creating a comprehensive, completely automated bill review software. I've fallen in love with coding.  In February 2022, I enrolled in a Full Stack Development professional certificate program through MITxPRO, to be completed Thanksgiving 2022.
